        This module carries a weight of 18 credits, indicating that a student
        should spend an average of 180 hours to master the required skills
        (including time spent preparing for tests and examinations). This means
        that you should devote an average of 12 hours of study time per week to
        this module. The scheduled contact time is approximately seven hours
        per week, which means that another five hours per week of own study
        time should be devoted to the module.

             \caption{Lecture Time Table}
            \end{center}
        \end{table}

        Lecture attendance and participation in discussions are compulsory.
        Since the contents of each lecture follow on those of previous lectures,
        it is in the students’ own interest to study the material covered on a regular
        basis and not to miss a lecture. However, should a student not be able to
        attend a certain lecture for whatever reason, the onus is on him / her to
        obtain the study material and catch up on the work. No individual lectures
        will be presented. Previous material will rarely be repeated in a following
        lecture.

        Students are expected to prepare for lectures. Since a large volume of work
        needs to be covered, it is not possible to lecture every aspect in the
        finest detail. Students should therefore read the textbooks thoroughly
        and already know beforehand what the next lecture is about in order to
        identify anything that is unclear. The lecturer may also assign some
        sections of the study notes and lecture notes / handouts for self-study.
        These sections will be part of the syllabus, but will not be discussed
        in the class.

        Dr Wilke will present the lectures in Afrikaans and Mr Page will present
        the lectures in English (according to the time table shown above). The
        lectures are split as per the time table above. Please refer to Click-Up
        for any time table updates.

    \subsection{Tutorials}

                 \hline

             \end{tabular}
             \caption{Tutorial Time Table}
            \end{center}
        \end{table}

        Tutorial sessions will be used to further develop the students
        understanding and knowledge of the topics covered in lectures by
        solving numerous engineering and mathematical problems with the
        tools introduced in this module.

        Each week's tutorial session will be used to review the previous week's
        lecture content and concepts. Selected exercise problems, from the
        study notes, will be covered during the tutorial sessions. The
        selected chapters and problems, that will be covered in each tutorial
        session, will be added to Click-UP.

        It is vital that students do these tutorial problems on their own,
        prior to attending the tutorial session, and use the tutorial session
        for getting help with problems and / or concepts that the student is
        struggling with.

        Tutorial session attendance and participation in discussions are
        compulsory. Since the contents of each tutorial session follows on
        those of previous tutorial session, it is in the students’ own
        interest to study the material covered on a regular basis and not
        to miss a tutorial session.

        It will be to the benefit of the student to complete these problems as
        similar forms of the problems may be asked in the tests or exam.
        Students may also make use of the discussion board on Click-UP should
        you have a specific question regarding a given tutorial problem and /
        or concept.

    \subsection{Homework Problems}
        The lecturer may provide analytical problems, during the course of the
        semester, in order to enhance the students’ independent skills to
        formulate the problem physics and analyse the applications of the
        theory. Students must independently work out the problems in their
        own time. The problems must be submitted electronically, before the
        announced deadline date, as they will be evaluated and count for marks.

        \textbf{Note:} Homework problems must be done independently. All
        electronically submitted material is easily checked for plagiarism,
        which will not be tolerated. Refer to the Departmental Study Guide
        (see section \ref{sec:dep_study_guide}) for more information on
        plagiarism.
