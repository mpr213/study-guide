    \subsection{Teaching Assistants}
        The contact details and consulting hours for the teaching assistants
        will be added to {\it ClickUP} as soon as the teaching assistants have been
        allocated.

    \subsection{Consulting Hours}
        Consultation hours of the lecturers and teaching assistants will be
        announced at the start of the semester. These hours will also be
        displayed on their office doors and on {\it ClickUP}. These hours indicate
        when the lecturers and teaching assistants are on campus and available
        for consultation. Students are requested to please make an appointment
        so as to ensure that the lecturers and teaching assistants are in their
        offices.

        Students are welcome to make special arrangements to see the
        lecturers at times outside of their consulting hours if
        necessary. It is important not to wait until just before a
        test or exam to clarify any problems. There will be no
        extraordinary consulting hours during test and exam time.

        Students are also welcome to make use of the discussion board
        on the new {\it ClickUP} system. This will allow lecturers,
        teaching assistants and fellow students to answer any queries
        regarding programming concepts, exercise problems, etc. during
        their free time.
